					Hi, my name is Will Harrison. I have an amazing family with a beautiful wife and 2 awesome daughters!
					I have been fascinated by computers and programming since I was very young.
					The reason I'm taking this class is because, although I've done some programming over the years, I feel 
					like my knowledge and expertise is very limited. I'm excited to learn from experts in the industry!
				</p>

					I love playing sports like Softball, Ultimate frisbee, etc. Playing and listening to music is another thing I really enjoy. 
					I learned how to play guitar when i was in my teenage years, then started taking piano lessons from an amazing piano 
					teacher. I also love to read books and play video games when I have free time. I love hanging out with family and friends 
					and playing the dragon ball super card game.
